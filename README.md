### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnet a lot about flexbox with the help of this challenge.

### Continued development

I still want to continue this project to near perfection. it's still not responsive and not mobile friendly. I still have to learn how to align content to the right as provided in the jpg also how to decorate the text as provided in the jpeg.

In future I would like to convert it into a React Project.
